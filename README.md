# Example of Testing `copier` with `gomock` in Go

This repository provides an example of how to test struct value copying using the `copier` package with `gomock` in Go. It demonstrates how to set up mocks and validate the behavior of the `Copy` method, both when it succeeds and when it fails.

## Key Features

- **Mocking with `gomock`**: Demonstrates how to use `gomock` to create and configure mocks for the `copier` interface.
- **Test Scenarios**: Includes multiple test scenarios to handle various cases, such as successful copies and copy errors.
- **Direct Copy Validation**: Shows how to validate that values are correctly copied between structs.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Go packages if needed.
3. Run `go test` to execute the tests.

## Files Included

- `copier.go`: Contains the `Copier` interface and its implementation.
- `authorization_service.go`: Implements the service that uses the copier.
- `authorization_service_test.go`: Contains tests for the `AuthorizationService` using `gomock`.

## Example Usage

Here is a brief overview of how the `AuthorizationService` and `copier` are used and tested:

1. **`copier.go`**: Defines the `Copier` interface and provides an implementation.
2. **`authorization_service.go`**: Implements a service that uses the `Copier` interface to copy data between structs.
3. **`authorization_service_test.go`**: Contains unit tests for the `AuthorizationService`, utilizing `gomock` to mock the `Copier` and test various scenarios.
